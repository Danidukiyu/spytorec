## 💡 Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No sound recorded           | Verify Spotify is routed to virtual device                         |
| "Device not found"          | Run `list-devices` and use the full audio device name              |
| Beginning cut off           | Lower `--interval` (e.g. 0.3 or 0.2)                               |
| Corrupted duration          | Ensure `ffmpeg` finalizer runs successfully                       |
| Ads in recording            | Use Spotify Premium  (eventhough Ads won't recorded in Free Subscriptions)                                              |
